COMP266 Project - Website for SVCrafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Current Status: Working through Unit 3 - CSS Site Styling.

This website serves two purposes: a project for AthabascaU COMP 266, and a central location for my small business, SVCrafted. Throughout the process, each step will be documented as Units.

Unit 0 - Introduction: As the title suggests, this unit was about orienting myself to the course and thinking of an idea for my project.

Unit 1 - Site Design: This stage included creating a wide variety of personas, including accessibility and priorities in my design considerations, and planning the look, feel, and function of the website. In addition to the personas and character profiles, the output of this unit included a wireframe of the site and layout designs for each page.

Unit 2 - HTML Site Building: This stage involved building all the HTML for the website, including each .html page and the code contained within them.

Unit 3 - CSS Site Styling: This stage involves styling all existing HTML pages and adjusting the HTML as needed.
